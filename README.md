# tewnty20-before-after-block

First version of extensions to Twenty20 Image Before-After.

To install add in ttwenty.php
...
include_once('blocks/before-after-block.php');
...

And upload files from catalog - blocks.

At this moment we must place image ID manual.
I'm working to implement MediaUpload function.
