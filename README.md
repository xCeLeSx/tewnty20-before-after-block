# tewnty20-before-after-block

First version of extensions to [Twenty20 Image Before-After](https://wordpress.org/plugins/twenty20/) plugin by [Zayed Baloch](https://zayedbaloch.com/).

This extensions add block to Gutenberg Editor.

To install it add in ttwenty.php below code:
```
include_once('blocks/before-after-block.php');
```

And upload files from catalog - **blocks**.

At this moment we must place image ID manual.
I'm working to implement MediaUpload function.
